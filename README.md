Full Stack Task Manager Web Application

Hello Everyone 👋

I have developed a professional Full Stack Task Manager web application using modern web technologies. This application helps users manage their personal, professional, and other daily tasks in an organized and secure way.

About the Application

This Task Manager application allows users to create, manage, and track tasks along with their subtasks. Users can edit their tasks anytime, and all data is securely stored in the backend database. Since the application supports long-term access, users can log in later and continue from where they left off.

The system is designed to be responsive, user-friendly, and scalable for real-world usage.
