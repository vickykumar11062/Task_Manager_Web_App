Hello Everyone...
<br/>
This is a Professional Task Manager App which I built<br/>
using React, Redux, Material UI, Express, MongoDB, Node JS, CSS.<br/>

In this application, you can store your personal, professional, and other tasks along with their subtasks. You can also edit them later.<br/>
All the user information and tasks are stored in the backend, so you can access them anytime.
